# Raspberry Pi – Vision and Decision Layer

The Raspberry Pi handles all high-level vision processing and decision logic.

## Responsibilities
- Motion detection using camera feed  
- Face recognition under controlled conditions  
- Triggering alerts and navigation decisions  

## Challenges Faced
- CPU overload during high frame-rate processing  
- Frame slicing and data loss during live video capture  

## Optimizations
- Reduced frame resolution  
- Controlled processing delays  
- Stable camera configuration  

The Raspberry Pi layer demonstrates how vision-based processing can be integrated into embedded robotic systems.
